# RotateBasis

A package that finds a calibration-optimal basis for high-dimensional computer model output, by combining important patterns contained in the observations with leading directions of variability in the ensemble.

Based on paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08184 (accepted by Journal of the American Statistical Association, publication in progress).

This package is still in development, with more updates to come by September 5th.
