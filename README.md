# RotateBasis

A package that finds a calibration-optimal basis for high-dimensional computer model output, by combining important patterns contained in the observations with leading directions of variability in the ensemble.

Based on paper https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2018.1514306.
